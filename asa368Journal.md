## Comparison between hybrid/native applications <br>
Hybrid applications are pretty nice since they can be built for different systems and in different formats.
Hybrid apps also have different functions and different ways to store data compared to native applications. Native applications are often much better optimized for the device itself and are probably better for production applications. Hybrid applications are better for quick prototyping so you can test your ideas very quickly. <br><br>

## Comparision between hybrid/cross-platform applications <br><br>
Hybrid applications have to be built separately for each device or production version while cross-platform applications are built once and work on multuple systems such as java. A java application can be built once and run on multuple differeny systems such as mac and windows as long as java is installed and supported.

One of the biggest problems that I had was an error when submitting my form, I emailed and the TA helped me resolve it. I was very dissapointed in not figuring it out sooner because it was just the fact that I was declaring my service in the class rather than the constructor. Another problem that I ran into was attempting to build the ios app. I got it 95% of the way but without a developer account it is impossible. I tried to sign up for the student one, but it is impossible without having a developer account. <br><br>
